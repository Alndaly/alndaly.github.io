## Getting lots of data: Artificial data synthesis

1. Make sure you have a low bias classifier before expending the effort.** (By plotting learning curves)**. E.g. keep increasing the number of features/number of hidden units in neural network until you have a low bias classifier.

2. “How much work would it be to get 10x as much data as we currently have?”  
    - Artificial data synthesis  
    - Collect/label it yourself
    - “Crowd source” (E.g. Amazon Mechanical Turk)
